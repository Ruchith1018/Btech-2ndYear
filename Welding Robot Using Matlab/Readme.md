# Welding Robot Using MATLAB

## Overview

This repository contains MATLAB code and resources for controlling a welding robot. The project involves developing and implementing algorithms to automate welding tasks using a robotic arm, enhancing precision and efficiency in welding operations.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `Welding Robot Using MATLAB/`: Contains the main source code and resources for the welding robot system.
  - `Welding.mlx`: Contains MATLAB scripts for controlling the robotic arm and performing welding operations.
  - `Results/`: Contains MATLAB models and simulations used for testing and validating the robotic system.
  

## Algorithms and Techniques

This project utilizes various algorithms and techniques for robot control and welding automation, including:

- **Motion Planning**: Algorithms to plan and execute the robotic arm's movements.
- **Path Following**: Techniques to ensure accurate and consistent welding paths.
- **Simulation**: MATLAB models to simulate the welding process and robot behavior.

## Dependencies
