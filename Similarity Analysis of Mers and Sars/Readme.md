# Similarity Analysis of MERS and SARS

## Overview

This repository contains Python code and resources for analyzing the similarities between MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) and SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome). The project aims to compare the genetic sequences of these viruses to identify commonalities and differences, which can provide insights into their evolution and potential cross-species transmission.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `Similarity Analysis of Mers and Sars/`: Contains the main scripts and data files used for similarity analysis.

## Dependencies
This project uses the following Python libraries:

- numpy
- pandas
- scipy
- biopython
- matplotlib


## Data
- The dataset used for this project includes genetic sequences of MERS and SARS. The data is stored in the data/ directory. Make sure to download the necessary data files and place them in this directory before running the analysis.

## Results
- The results of the analysis will be saved in the ipynb file itself. You can find various output files, including similarity scores and visualizations.
