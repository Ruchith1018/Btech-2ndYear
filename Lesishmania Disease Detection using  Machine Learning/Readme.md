# Lesishmania Disease Detection using Machine Learning

## Project Overview

This repository contains the code and resources for the "Lesishmania Disease Detection using Machine Learning" project. The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model to detect and classify Lesishmania disease from medical data. The project leverages various machine learning techniques to achieve accurate detection and classification results.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains the dataset used for training and testing the model.

## Dataset

The dataset for this project is obtained from kaggle. It consists of medical csv file labeled for Lesishmania disease detection.

## Model

The project uses machine learning algorithms to detect and classify Lesishmania disease. The model is trained on the provided dataset and evaluated based on performance metrics.

## Results

The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Detailed results and evaluation metrics can be found in the `notebooks/` directory.
