# Encryption and Decryption using Fourier Matrices

## Project Overview

This repository contains the code and resources for the "Encryption and Decryption using Fourier Matrices" project. The goal of this project is to implement encryption and decryption algorithms based on Fourier matrices using MATLAB. This approach explores the application of Fourier transforms in cryptographic processes.

## Project Structure

- `src/`: MATLAB scripts for encryption, decryption, and related operations.
- `data/`: Sample data files used for testing the encryption and decryption algorithms.
- `results/`: Output results and visualizations from the encryption and decryption processes.
- `requirements.txt`: List of MATLAB toolboxes or dependencies required for running the project.

## Files

- `end_sem.m`: MATLAB script for implementing the encryption algorithm using Fourier matrices.
- `decryption.m`: MATLAB script for implementing the decryption algorithm.


## Usage

1. Open MATLAB and navigate to the `src/` directory.
2. Run the `encryption.m` script to perform encryption on the sample data.
3. Run the `decryption.m` script to perform decryption and verify the results.

## Results

The `results/` directory contains the output and visualizations of the encryption and decryption processes. Check the `visualizations.m` script for graphical representations.
