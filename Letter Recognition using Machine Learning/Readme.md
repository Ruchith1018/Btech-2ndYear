# Letter Recognition using Machine Learning

## Overview

This repository contains code and resources for a machine learning project focused on letter recognition. The project employs multiple algorithms to classify letters from images, including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Decision Trees. The goal is to develop and compare different machine learning models for accurate letter recognition.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `Letter Recognition using Machine Learning/`: Contains the main source code and resources for the letter recognition system.
  - `data/`: Contains datasets used for training and testing the models.
  - `src/`: Contains Python scripts for data processing, model training, and evaluation.
  - `results/`: Contains output files, model performance metrics, and evaluation results.

## Algorithms Used

This project implements and evaluates the following machine learning algorithms:

- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: A simple, instance-based learning algorithm used for classification based on the majority vote of the nearest neighbors.
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: A powerful classifier that finds the optimal hyperplane to separate different classes.
- **Decision Tree**: A tree-like model used for classification, which splits data into subsets based on feature values.

## Dependencies

This project requires the following Python libraries:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`

These libraries are listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

## Data

The dataset used for this project include dimensions of of letters for training and testing the models. The data is stored in the `letter_recognition.csv` file. Ensure that the dataset files are correctly placed in this directory.

## Results

The results of the analysis include model performance metrics for each algorithm, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. These results are saved in the `ipynb` file.
